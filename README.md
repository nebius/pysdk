Nebius Python SDK
=================

Issues and TODOs:

 * Fieldmasks not implemented (Update requests have to be manually filled)

### Installation

If you've received this module in a zip archive or checked out from git, install it as follows:

```bash
pip install ./path/to/your/pysdk
```

### Example

Working examples in `src/examples`.
Try it out as follows:
```bash
NEBIUS_IAM_TOKEN=$(nebius iam get-access-token) python -m ./path/to/your/pysdk/src/examples/basic.py your-project-id
```

### How-to

#### Initialize

```python
from nebius.sdk import SDK

sdk = SDK()
```

This will initialize the SDK with IAM token from `NEBIUS_IAM_TOKEN` env var.
If you want to use different ways of authorization, see next.

See the following how-to's on how to provide your crerentials.

##### Initialize using IAM Token

You can also initialize the same token these ways:

```python
import os
from nebius.sdk import SDK
from nebius.aio.token.static import Bearer, EnvBearer
from nebius.aio.token.token import Token

sdk = SDK(credentials=os.environ.get("NEBIUS_IAM_TOKEN", ""))
#or
sdk = SDK(credentials=Bearer(os.environ.get("NEBIUS_IAM_TOKEN", "")))
#or
sdk = SDK(credentials=EnvBearer("NEBIUS_IAM_TOKEN"))
#or
sdk = SDK(credentials=Bearer(Token(os.environ.get("NEBIUS_IAM_TOKEN", ""))))
```

Now, your application will get token from the local Env variable, as in the example above.

##### Initialize with the private key file

Replace in the following example IDs of your service account and the public key pair for your private key.
You need to have `private_key.pem` file on your machine.

```python
from nebius.sdk import SDK
from nebius.base.service_account.pk_file import Reader as PKReader

sdk = SDK(
    credentials=PKReader(
        filename="location/of/your/private_key.pem",
        public_key_id="public-key-id",
        service_account_id="your-service-account-id",
    ),
)
#or without importing PKReader:
sdk = SDK(
    service_account_private_key_file_name="location/of/your/private_key.pem",
    service_account_public_key_id="public-key-id",
    service_account_id="your-service-account-id",
)
```

##### Initialize with credentials

Assuming you have a joint credentials file with private key and all the IDs included.

```python
from nebius.sdk import SDK
from nebius.base.service_account.credentials_file import Reader as CredentialsReader

sdk = SDK(
    credentials=CredentialsReader(
        filename="location/of/your/credentials.json",
    ),
)
#or without importing CredentialsReader:
sdk = SDK(
    credentials_file_name="location/of/your/credentials.json",
)
```

#### Test the SDK

To test the SDK, you have a convenient method `SDK.whoami`, that will return basic info about the profile, you've authenticated with.

SDK is created around asyncio, so the best is to call it from async context:

```python
import asyncio

async def my_call():
    print(await sdk.whoami())

asyncio.run(my_call)
```

But if you haven't started async loop, you can run it synchronously:

```python
print(sdk.whoami().wait())
```
But this may lead to problems or infinite locks, even if timeouts have been added. Moreover, sync methods won't run in async call stack, if you haven't provided a dedicated separate loop for the SDK, and even then there might be issues, eg infinite blocks.

#### Call some method

Now as you have your SDK initialized and tested, you can call services methods with it. We assume, that `sdk` is created.

All the generated API is located in `nebius.api.nebius`.

The following example tries to get a bucket from storage

```python
import asyncio

from nebius.api.nebius.storage.v1 import GetBucketRequest
from nebius.api.nebius.storage.v1 import BucketServiceClient

async def my_call():
    service = BucketServiceClient(sdk)
    return await service.get(GetBucketRequest(
        id="some-bucket-id",
    ))

asyncio.run(my_call())
```

Same thing synchronously:

```python
import asyncio

from nebius.api.nebius.storage.v1 import GetBucketRequest
from nebius.api.nebius.storage.v1 import BucketServiceClient

service = BucketServiceClient(sdk)
result = service.get(GetBucketRequest(
    id="some-bucket-id",
)).wait()
```

##### Poll operations

Some methods return `nebius.aio.Operation`, which needs to be finished, for instance `Create` request from the `BucketService`. Operations can be waited till completion.

Assuming, we are already in async context:

```python
from nebius.api.nebius.storage.v1 import CreateBucketRequest

service = BucketServiceStub(sdk)
operation = await service.create(CreateBucketRequest(
    # fill-in necessary fields
))
await operation.wait()
print(f"New bucket ID: {operation.resource_id}")
```

Or synchronously:
```python
from nebius.api.nebius.storage.v1 import CreateBucketRequest

service = BucketServiceStub(sdk)
operation = service.create(CreateBucketRequest(
    # fill-in necessary fields
)).wait()
operation.wait_sync()
print(f"New bucket ID: {operation.resource_id}")
```

##### Retrieve additional metadata

Sometimes you need more than just a result, for instance if you have problems, you want to provide your request ID and trace ID to Nebius support teams.

```python
request = service.get(req)  # Note, that we don't await immediately

# all three can be awaited in any order, or simultaneously
response = await request
request_id = await request.request_id()
trace_id = await request.trace_id()

log.info(f"Server answered: {response}; Request ID: {request_id} and Trace ID: {trace_id}")
```
Or in case of synchronous:

```python
request = service.get(req)  # Note, that we don't await immediately

# all three can be called in any order, the first call will start the request
response = request.wait()
request_id = request.request_id_sync()
trace_id = request.trace_id_sync()

log.info(f"Server answered: {response}; Request ID: {request_id} and Trace ID: {trace_id}")
```

##### Parse errors

Sometimes things go wrong. There are many exceptions a request can raise, but some of them are created on a server. These exceptions will derive from `nebius.aio.service_error.RequestError`. This error will contain request status and additional information from the server, if there was any.

You can just print the RequestError to see all the info in readable format, or you can parse `nebius.aio.service_error.RequestStatusExtended` located in `caught_error.status`, which will contain all the information in structured form.

```python
from nebius.aio.service_error import RequestError
from nebius.base.service_error import from_error

try:
    response = await service.get(req)
except RequestError as e:
    log.exception(f"Caught request error {e}")
```

Do not forget to save request ID and trace ID from the output, in case you will submit something to support.

### Call `Update` methods

`Update` methods require `ResetMask` masks to be passed alongside the request, if you want to set some fields to default. Currently, there's no python library to support Nebius `ResetMask`, so you have to create the masks yourself.

```python
from nebius.api.nebius.storage.v1 import UpdateBucketRequest

operation = await service.update(
    UpdateBucketRequest(), # if we send it without metadata, it won't update anything
    metadata=[
        ("x-reset-mask","spec.max_size_bytes")  # we reset max_size_bytes to 0 â€” unlimited
        ("x-reset-mask","spec.versioning_policy")  # you can add multiple masks, they will be combined
    ]
)
```
You can use `nebius.base.metadata.Metadata` container to work with metadata, it gives some helper functions and conveniences, as well as automatically converts all the headers from http-like to grpc-compliant lowercase.

**Note**: Our internal field masks have more granularity than google ones, so they are incompatible.
